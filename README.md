# What is MapStruct? - [https://mapstruct.org/](https://mapstruct.org/)
MapStruct is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach.
The generated mapping code uses plain method invocations and thus is fast, type-safe and easy to understand.
## Why?
Multi-layered applications often require to map between different object models (e.g. entities and DTOs). Writing such mapping code is a tedious and error-prone task. MapStruct aims at simplifying this work by automating it as much as possible.
In contrast to other mapping frameworks MapStruct generates bean mappings at compile-time which ensures a high performance, allows for fast developer feedback and thorough error checking.
## How?
MapStruct is an annotation processor which is plugged into the Java compiler and can be used in command-line builds (Maven, Gradle etc.) as well as from within your preferred IDE.
MapStruct uses sensible defaults but steps out of your way when it comes to configuring or implementing special behavior.
## What is inside?
The project presents the most commonly used cases of mapping.
